Repository for JamFox's website, CI and hosting by Gatsby.

## Under the hood

1.  **`/node_modules`**: Contains all of the npm packages that this project depends on.

2.  **`/src`**: Contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: Tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: Main configuration file for a Gatsby site. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: File is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

7.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.
