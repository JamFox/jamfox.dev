            SECTION 4 - MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICE AND ENCABULATOR
          </h2>
          <p>
            For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to
            bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission
            that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in
            unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of
            automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument
            is the turbo encabulator. Now basically the only new principle
            involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative
            motion of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial
            interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance. The
            original machine had a base plate of pre-famulated amulite
            surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the
            two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan.
            The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so
            fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was
            effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal
            lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the
            stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible
            tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the “up” end of the
            grammeters. The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of
            development, and it's being successfully used in the operation of
            novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion is
            required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn
            reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.

          <p>
            Look, we've evolved to eat ass. That's why we have canine teeth.
            Animals in the wild eat ass all the time, so why would you give me
            flack for just going along with nature? I'm not a fucking herbivore.
            The human body needs ass to function. If I were to stop eating them,
            I would go weak. Don't you get shaky and pale on a non-ass diet?
            Supplements aren't enough, and fake ass is disgusting. At the end of
            the day, I just think my love of ass trumps the rights of ass. I
            mean, they're just ass. They're stupid. I'm an intelligent adult,
            and so I clearly fall into a different moral category.

          <h2 id="s13">SECTION 13 - HISTORY AND CREATION OF CHESS</h2>
          <p>
            The first know recording of the problem is from 1256 by the Islamic
            scholar Ibn Khallikan. The story revolves around the inventor of
            chess, in some versions of the story the role is played by Sissa a
            mythological creature from India known for the invention of
            Chaturanga, a predecessor to Chess. In other versions of the main
            protagonist might is a mathematician, a minister, or in some a
            stranger or someone of poor decent like a farmer. The story often
            has a ruler of some sort approach the protagonist and ask them to
            entertain them with a new game. The inventor presents their ruler
            with the game of chess and the ruler asks the inventor for his
            price. The inventor ponders this ask for a simple offering based on
            his creation. A single grain of rice or some versions say wheat, on
            the first square and double that amount on the second square and
            double that amount on the third square and so one for the sixty-four
            squares of the chessboard. The ruler laughs at the meager price and
            accepts but his court treasurer tells him that the staggering about
            of rice, or wheat, needed to fill the board in this manner. The
            total would be eighteen quintillions, four hundred forty-six
            quadrillion, seven hundred forty-four trillion, seventy-three
            billion, seven hundred nine million, five hundred fifty-one
            thousand, six hundred and fifteen, over one point four trillion
            metric tons. Or put simply which is over two thousand times the
            annual world production of wheat, which in the period twenty-twenty
            to twenty-twenty-one was an estimated about seven hundred
            seventy-three million metric tones. Anyway, the stories do differ
            and this point. Some say that the inventor gets offered a nice
            position as a high-ranking advisor and in other versions, he gets
            executed. Now there is probably a moral here but low and behold I am
            out of character. One could say that is the definition of irony,
            isn't it?

            well for many years, the king granted Triboulet the right to choose
            how he would die. Triboulet, with his sharp mind, said the following
            (translated from the original French): "Good sire, by Saint Goody
            Two Shoes and Saint Fatty, patrons of insanity, I ask to die from
            old age." Having no other choice than to laugh, the king ordered
            that Triboulet not be executed but instead be banished from the
            realm.
